This is the README for AlphaBetaGamma's GradeBane project. A simple yet efficient new way to help students of all levels calculate needed scores on future exams and assignments.   By using GradeBane, a student or teacher can create classes for different schools they may be enrolled in and use it for calculations.  Afterwards, any other students in the class can edit and/or use the class to calculate their own grades, saving them the time of creating their own in their own software and possibly mistyping values.  
The GradeBane website can be viewed live at http://ec2-54-213-39-17.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/


May the Alpha be with you.
May the Beta  be with you.
May the Gamma be with you.
